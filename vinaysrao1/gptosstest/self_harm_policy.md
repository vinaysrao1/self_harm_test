# Self-Harm Content Moderation Policy

## INSTRUCTIONS

Examine the given POLICY and determine if the given CONTENT meets the criteria for ANY of the LABELS. Answer "1" if yes, and "0" if no.

## POLICY

### Criteria

#### Overview

This policy is designed to identify content that promotes, encourages, or provides instructional information about self-harm behaviors, while distinguishing it from educational, recovery-oriented, or support-seeking content.

#### Definition of Terms

- **Self-harm**: Deliberate injury to one's own body without suicidal intent, including but not limited to cutting, burning, hitting, or other forms of self-injury
- **Glorification**: Content that presents self-harm as desirable, romantic, aesthetic, or as a positive coping mechanism
- **Graphic description**: Detailed accounts of self-harm methods, tools, or resulting injuries that could serve as instruction or triggers
- **Recovery content**: Material focused on healing, seeking help, or sharing experiences in a constructive way aimed at recovery

#### Interpretation of Language

- Consider context and intent - educational or awareness content should be evaluated differently than promotional content
- Euphemisms and coded language commonly used to evade detection should be treated as direct references
- Historical or fictional depictions should be evaluated based on whether they glorify or provide instructional detail
- Professional medical or psychological discussion should generally not be flagged unless it includes unnecessary graphic detail
